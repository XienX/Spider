A GRADIENT DISCRETISATION METHOD FOR ANISOTROPIC
REACTION DIFFUSION MODELS WITH APPLICATIONS TO
THE DYNAMICS OF BRAIN TUMOURS
YAHYA ALNASHRI AND HASAN ALZUBAIDI
Abstract. A gradient discretisation method (GDM) is an abstract setting
that designs the uniﬁed convergence analysis of several numerical methods for
partial diﬀerential equations and their corresponding models. In this paper,
we study the GDM for anisotropic reaction diﬀusion problems, based on a gen-
eral reaction term, with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. With
natural regularity assumptions on the exact solution, the framework enables
us to provide proof of the existence of weak solutions for the problem, and to
obtain a uniform–in–time convergence for the discrete solution and a strong
convergence for its discrete gradient. It also allows us to apply non conform-
ing numerical schemes to the model on a generic grid; (the Crouzeix–Raviart
scheme and the hybrid mixed mimetic (HMM) methods). Numerical experi-
ments using the HMM method are performed to study the growth of glioma
tumours in heterogeneous brain environment. The dynamics of their highly
diﬀusive nature is also measured using the fraction anisotropic measure. The
validity of the HMM is examined further using four diﬀerent mesh types. The
results indicate that the dynamics of the brain tumour is still captured by the
HMM scheme, even in the event of a highly heterogeneous anisotropic case
performed on the mesh with extreme distortions.
1. Introduction
In this paper, we study the following anisotropic reaction diﬀusion model:
(xxx, t) ∈ Ω × (0, T ),
∂t ¯c(xxx, t) − div (cid:0)A(xxx)∇¯c(xxx, t)(cid:1) = F (¯c(xxx, t)),
(xxx, t) ∈ ∂Ω × (0, T ),
∇¯c(xxx, t) · n = 0,
¯c(·, 0) = cini on Ω.
With a particular choice of the reaction term F , the model can expresses brain
tumours, in which unknown ¯c represents the density of cancerous cells, and homo-
geneous zero ﬂux boundary conditions state that there is no diﬀusion of tumor cells
out-with the brain region and the domain Ω ⊂ Rd , (d ≥ 1).
Invasive diﬀuse brain tumors that frequently recur in spite of the improvements
in therapy plans in recent years, gliomas can often prove fatal within six months to
a year of recurrence [35, 40]. Treatment plans generally encompass chemotherapy,

radiotherapy, and surgery, but despite all the advances in these therapies, it is
still rare for such tumors to be completely cured [31, 36]. A primary problem in
the treatment of glioma is that they are highly diﬀusive and have heterogeneous
invasion rates that create invisible antigen tumors that cannot be detected with
current resolutions of imaging [30, 31, 36]. The heterogeneous spread pattern is
probably attributable to the anisotropic invasion of glioma cells through the brain’s
aligned structures, e.g., the bundled neural ﬁber tracts that characterize white
matter [19, 20, 30]. The brain chieﬂy comprises two forms of tissue, white matter
and gray matter. Gray matter comprises glial and neuronal cell bodies controlling
the activity of the brain; white matter is used by glioma cells as an invasion route
between areas of gray matter [30]. Evidence from research has suggested that within
white matter tumor diﬀusion is anisotropic, while within gray matter it is isotropic
[2, 20].
One means of forecasting the invasive pathways is mathematical modeling, and
researchers have developed several macroscopic models using diﬀusion tensor imag-
ing (DTI) data for informing the architecture of white matter and simulating a
glioma’s non-uniform growth [26, 29]. DTI is a means of imaging that takes mea-
sures of the way in which water molecules are an-isotropically diﬀused within a
tissue and could potentially oﬀer predictions of how a tumor will expand and so
direct therapy planning [3, 28].
Reaction diﬀusion models have been created in order to forge a link between
medical imaging and tumor growth models. Tracqui et al.
[43] suggested one of
the earliest reaction diﬀusion models that integrated medical imaging information,
speciﬁcally tumor size and the brain’s geometry. Cruywagen at al [8] expanded on
this concept and suggested employing two tumor cell populations. Burgess et al.[4]
extended the model into three dimensions, emphasizing the part played in glioma
growth by diﬀusion. Many researchers have focused on the macroscopic process
of glioma expansion, employing reaction diﬀusion type partial diﬀerential equa-
tions (PDEs), with proliferation represented by the reaction term and inﬁltration
represented by the diﬀusion term [30].
The ﬁrst models made an assumption of homogeneous and isotropic growth with
A set as a constant and scalar diﬀusion; subsequent reaction models have been
employed for the description of the growth of such tumors within the brain’s het-
erogeneous environment. One example was Swanson et al.
[41] who examined a
spatially heterogeneous diﬀusion coeﬃcient, with A set as being notably greater
in white matter compared to gray matter for the description of the swifter inva-
sion noted in these regions. Swanson et al.
[42] expanded to a three–dimensional
model, using data regarding gray and white matter areas harvested from anatomi-
cal imaging. Furthermore, studies of medical images have demonstrated that tumor
cells have a tendency to follow water diﬀusion patterns; measurement of this can
be achieved by employing magnetic resonance diﬀusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI).
Expanding upon tumor cells’ diﬀerential motility within a variety of tissues in such
a context, numerous researchers have built inhomogenous diﬀusion tensors A in
order to model tumor cell diﬀusion using images from the diﬀusion tensor (DTI)
[26, 29, 39]. DTI oﬀers data regarding anisotropic diﬀusion as shown by eigenvalues
(magnitude) and eigenvectors (direction). The tensors were constructed by em-
ploying anisotropic (ellipsoid) diﬀusion for white matter, and isotropic (spherical)
tensors for gray matter [3, 28, 39].

While there has been much theoretical study of this model as part of a gen-
eral theory of reaction diﬀusion equations [37], it is typically very rare to solve
models that capture the gross behaviour of glioma tumors in heterogeneous brain
tissue based on data imaging. A number of diﬀerent numerical approaches for the
description of glioma tumors’ heterogeneous rate of invasion and the dynamics of
their highly diﬀusive nature (mostly without full convergence analysis) have been
employed, for example, see [6, 9, 22, 24, 25, 27, 34, 38, 44]. However, few studies have
so far been paid to the convergence analysis of non conforming methods for the re-
action diﬀusion equation and its corresponding models. For example, ﬁnite volume
method is proposed to approximate the convection diﬀusion reaction equations [23]
and the Nagumo–type equations [45].
In this work, we develop a gradient discretisation method (GDM) to the model
(1.1). The (GDM) is a generic framework that can ﬁnd a uniﬁed convergence anal-
ysis, in which be applicable to multiple families numerical schemes instead of con-
ducting individual convergence analysis for each numerical scheme. The eﬃciency
of the framework is ensured under a limited number of properties (depending on
the model). See the monograph [12] for details. By approximating the model (1.1)
by the GDM, we aﬀord
• Comprehensive convergence analysis of numerical schemes for anisotropic
reaction diﬀusion models.
• Analysis that carried out based on standard regularity assumptions on the
data, which can be established in realistic models.
• Analysis that can be easily extended to the model (1.1) with diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions.
• Implementation of ﬁnite volume methods which can be performed on generic
grids to deal with highly heterogeneous anisotropic problems.
This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the discrete elements
to approximate the considered reaction diﬀusion model together with some basic
properties to guarantee the convergence of approximation schemes. This is followed
by Section 3, which is concerned with the approximate scheme and its convergence
results. Section 4 presents two examples of non conforming schemes that ﬁt into
the gradient discretisation method and have been not yet proposed to any type of
anisotropic reaction diﬀusion models; the Crouzeix–Raviart scheme and the hybrid
mixed mimetic (HMM) methods. They simultaneously provide an approximation
of the solution and its gradient on a generic grid. In Section 5 we use the com-
pactness argument to prove our convergence results (Theorem 3.1) under natural
assumptions on data. This approach relies on establishing energy estimates on
a discrete solution under standard assumptions on the model data. One beneﬁt
of our analysis is to prove the existence of a weak solution to (1.1), which does
not need to be assumed. In Section 6 we show that the GDM can successfully be
extended to the reaction diﬀusion equations sub ject to non homogeneous Dirich-
let boundary condition. Finally, in Section 7, some numerical experiments using
the hybrid mixed mimetic (HMM) method are provided to study the growth of
brain tumours in heterogeneous environment. The validity of the HMM scheme is
examined further using anisotropic cases performed on diﬀerent generic meshes.

2. Discrete setting
The idea of the gradient discretisation method is to construct appropriate gra-
dient discretisations, made of discrete space and operators, to approximate the
continuous model provided that written in the weak sense. Writing the equivalent
weak formulation with replacing the continuous elements by the discrete ones yields
a numerical scheme called a gradient scheme (GS). Let us now start with recalling
the notions of the gradient discretisation method, that are suitable to discretise par-
tial diﬀerential equations with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions deﬁned
as in [12].
Deﬁnition 2.1 (gradient discretisations). Let Ω be an open subset of Rd (with
d ≥ 1) and T > 0. A gradient discretisations for the anisotropic reaction diﬀusion
model (1.1) is D = (XD , ΠD , ∇D , JD , (t(n) )n=0,...,N )), where
• the set of discrete unknowns XD is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space on R,
• the linear mapping ΠD : XD → L2 (Ω) is the reconstructed function,
• the linear mapping ∇D : XD → L2 (Ω)d is a reconstructed gradient, which
must be chosen such that
kϕ||D = ||ΠD ϕ||L2 (Ω) + ||∇D ϕ||L2 (Ω)d
(2.1)
is a norm on XD ,
• the linear continuous mapping JD : L2(Ω) → XD is an interpolation oper-
ator for the initial conditions,
• t(0) = 0 < t(1) < .... < t(N ) = T are time steps.
For (ϕ(n) )n∈N ⊂ XD , let us deﬁne the piecewise constant in time functions
ΠDϕ : (0, T ] → L2(Ω), ∇D ϕ : (0, T ] → L2 (Ω)d ,and δDϕ : (0, T ] → L2 (Ω) as
follows. For a.e xxx ∈ Ω, for all n ∈ {0, ..., N − 1} and for all t ∈ (t(n) , t(n+1) ],
ΠD ϕ(xxx, 0) := ΠD ϕ(0) (xxx), ΠDϕ(xxx, t) := ΠD ϕ(n+1) (xxx),
δDϕ(t) = δ

Due to the ﬂexibility of choices of gradient discretisations, various numerical
scheme families ﬁt into the GDM, starting from conforming, non conforming and
mixed ﬁnite elements to nodal mimetic ﬁnite diﬀerences and hybrid mimetic mixed
methods [10, 14–18]. Two examples are presented below and taken from [12].
Example 2.2. In conforming P1 ﬁnite element method, the discrete space XD
consists of vectors of values at the nodes of the mesh, the reconstructed operator
ΠDϕ is the piecewise linear continuous function that takes these values at the nodes,
and ∇D ϕ = ∇(ΠD ϕ).
For non conforming P1 ﬁnite element method, the discrete space XD is made
of piecewise linear functions on a triangle T , which are continuous at the edge
mid-points. Unlike the conforming methods, the reconstructed operators are re-
spectively ΠD = I d and ∇D = ∇B (the broken gradient), i.e.,
for all ϕ ∈ XD , for all a triangle τ ∈ T , ∇B ϕ(xxx) = ∇(ϕ|τ ), ∀xxx ∈ τ .
As a means of constructing converging schemes, the gradient discretisations el-
ements must take the properties of continuous space and operators. The quality

of the choice of gradient discretisations elements can be measured through two pa-
rameters, correspond to errors in an interpolation of function by smooth ones and
a discrete Stokes formula.
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Consistency). For ϕ ∈ H 1 (Ω), deﬁne SD : H 1 (Ω) → [0, +∞) by
SD (ϕ) = min
(2.2)
w∈XD (cid:0)kΠD w − ϕkL2 (Ω) + k∇D w − ∇ϕkL2 (Ω)d (cid:1) .
A sequence (Dm )m∈N of gradient discretisations is consistent if, as m → ∞
• for all ϕ ∈ H 1 (Ω), SDm (ϕ) → 0,
• for all ϕ ∈ L2 (Ω), ΠDm JDm ϕ → ϕ strongly in L2 (Ω),
• δ tDm → 0.
Deﬁnition 2.4 (Limit–conformity). For ψ ∈ Hdiv , deﬁne WD : Hdiv → [0, +∞)
by
(∇D w · ψ + ΠD w div(ψ)) dxxx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
where Hdiv = {ψ ∈ L2 (Ω)d : divψ ∈ L2(Ω), ψ · n = 0 on ∂Ω}.
A sequence (Dm )m∈N of gradient discretisations is limit-conforming if for all
ψ ∈ Hdiv , WDm (ψ) → 0, as m → ∞.
Lastly, to address non linearity coming from the reaction term, the operator ΠD
is required to meet the compactness properties, as outlined below.
WD (ψ ) = sup

Deﬁnition 2.5 (Compactness). A sequence of gradient discretisations (Dm )m∈N
in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1 is compact if for any sequence (ϕm )m∈N ∈ XDm , such
that (||ϕm ||Dm )m∈N is bounded, the sequence (ΠDm ϕm )m∈N is relatively compact
in L2 (Ω).
3. Main Results
As explained before, the GDM relies on the weak formulation. We introduce
here the weak formulation and its approximation scheme created from the gradient
discretisations presented in the previous section. We consider the problem (1.1)
under the following assumptions:
Ω is an open bounded connected subset of Rd (d ≥ 1) with a Lipschitz boundary,
(3.1a)
T > 0, cini ∈ L2 (Ω),
A : Ω → Md (R) is a measurable function (where Md (R) is the set of d × d matrices)
and there exists λ, λ > 0 such that for a.e. xxx ∈ Ω,
(3.1b)
A(xxx) is symmetric with eigenvalues in [λ, λ],
F : R → R is a polynomial function, such that F ∈ L2 (Ω × (0, T )),
and there exists constants CF 1 , CF 2 ≥ 0 such that for any s ∈ R,
|F (s)| ≤ CF 1 + CF 2 |s|.

Under assumptions (3.1), ¯c is said to be a weak solution of (1.1) if
¯c ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1(Ω)) and, for all ¯ϕ ∈ L2 (0, T ; H 1(Ω)),
such that, ∂t ¯ϕ ∈ L2(Ω × (0, T )) and ¯ϕ(·, T ) = 0,

4. 2–Examples covered by the analysis
The analysis designed in this work can be applicable to many numerical schemes.
We show here that two diﬀerent non conforming methods can be expressed as the
gradient schemes formats (3.3). To do so, let us begin by recalling the deﬁnition of
a generic polyhedral mesh as in [14].
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Polytopal mesh). Let Ω be a bounded polytopal open subset of
Rd (d ≥ 1). A polytopal mesh of Ω is given by T = (M, E , P ), where:
(1) M is a ﬁnite family of non empty connected polytopal open disjoint subsets
of Ω (the cells) such that Ω = ∪K∈MK . For any K ∈ M, |K | > 0 is the
measure of K and hK denotes the diameter of K .
(2) E is a ﬁnite family of disjoint subsets of Ω (the edges of the mesh in 2D, the
faces in 3D), such that any σ ∈ E is a non empty open subset of a hyperplane
of Rd and σ ⊂ Ω. We assume that for all K ∈ M there exists a subset EK
of E such that ∂K = ∪σ∈EK σ . We then set Mσ = {K ∈ M : σ ∈ EK }
and assume that, for all σ ∈ E , Mσ has exactly one element and σ ⊂ ∂Ω,
or Mσ has two elements and σ ⊂ Ω. Eint is the set of all interior faces, i.e.
σ ∈ E such that σ ⊂ Ω, and Eext the set of boundary faces, i.e. σ ∈ E such
that σ ⊂ ∂Ω. For σ ∈ E , the (d − 1)-dimensional measure of σ is |σ |, the
centre of mass of σ is xσ , and the diameter of σ is hσ .
(3) P = (xK )K∈M is a family of points of Ω indexed by M and such that, for
all K ∈ M, xK ∈ K (xK

discretisations satisﬁes the three properties; the consistency, the limit conformity,
and the compactness. Therefore, Theorem 3.1 provides the convergence of the
Crouzeix–Raviart scheme for the anisotropic reaction diﬀusion model.
4.2. The hybrid mixed mimetic (HMM) method. It is found by [13] that the
HMM method is a framework gathering three diﬀerent schemes: the (mixed-hybrid)
mimetic ﬁnite diﬀerences methods, the hybrid ﬁnite volume method, and the mixed
ﬁnite volume methods. The method can also be compatible with a generic mesh
with non orthogonality assumptions. Let T be a polytopal mesh of Ω deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 4.1.
(1) The discrete space is
XD = {v = ((ϕK )K∈M , (ϕσ )σ∈E ) : ϕK , ϕσ ∈ R, }.
(2) The non conforming a piecewise aﬃne reconstruction ΠD is deﬁned by
∀ϕ ∈ XD , ∀K ∈ M, for a.e. xxx ∈ K,
ΠD ϕ = ϕK on K .
(3) The reconstructed gradients is piecewise constant on the cells (broken gra-
dient), deﬁned by
∀ϕ ∈ XD , ∀K ∈ M, ∀σ ∈ EK ,
RK (ϕ)nK,σ on DK,σ ,
√d
∇D ϕ = ∇K ϕ +
where a cell–wise constant gradient ∇K (ϕ) and a stabilisation term RK (ϕ)
are respectively deﬁned by:

(4) The interpolant JD : L2(Ω) → XD is deﬁned by:
∀w ∈ L2(Ω) : JD w = ((wK )K∈M , (wσ )σ∈E ),
w(xxx) dxxx and ∀σ ∈ E , wσ = 0.
∀K ∈ M, wK =
The HMM scheme of Problem (3.2) is the gradient scheme (3.3) with the gradient
discretisations constructed above, it reads

It is proved in [12, Chapter 9] that this gradient discretisations satisﬁes the three
properties; the consistency, the limit conformity and the compactness. Therefore,
Theorem 3.1 provides the convergence of the HMM scheme for the anisotropic
reaction diﬀusion model.

5. Proof of The Main Results
In order to prove our convergence results, the discrete solution and its gradient
must possess some energy estimates, which are established in the following lemmas.
Lemma 5.1 (Estimates). Under assumptions (3.1), let D be a gradient discretisa-
tions and let c ∈ XD be a solution to the gradient scheme (3.3). Then there exists
a constant C1 ≥ 0 depending only on CF 1 , CF 2 , Ω and ||ΠD c(0) ||L2 (Ω) , such that

Corollary 5.2. Let D be a gradient discretisations. Under assumptions (3.1), the
gradient scheme (3.3) admits at least one solution c ∈ XD .
Proof. At each time step n+1, (3.3) describes square non linear equations on c(n+1) .
For a given w ∈ XD , c ∈ XD is a solution to the linear square system

where C not depending on c(n+1) . This shows that the kernel of the matrix built
from the linear system only has the zero vector. The matrix is therefore invertible.
We then can deﬁne the mapping T : XD → XD by T (w) = c with c is the solution
to (5.3). Since T is continuous, Brouwer’s ﬁxed point establishes the existence of a
solution c(n+1) to the system at time step n + 1.
(cid:3)
To reach the standard compactness, we need to establish a bound on the discrete

deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.3 (Dual norm on ΠD (XD )). Let D be a gradient discretisations. The

∀w ∈ ΠD (XD ), ||w||⋆,D = sup n ZΩ

Lemma 5.4 (Estimate on the dual norm of δD c). Assume (3.1) holds and let D
be a gradient discretisations. If c ∈ XD is a solution to the gradient scheme (3.3),
then there exists a constant C2 depending only on C1 , CF 1 , CF 2 and ||ΠD c(0) ||L2 (Ω) ,
such that

(cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 3.1. The proof relies on the compactness arguments as in [12],
and is divided into four stages.
Step 1: Compactness results. Given that Estimate (5.1) and the two prop-
erties of the gradient discretisations (consistency and the limit–conformity), [12,
Lemma 4.8] shows that there exists ¯c ∈ L2 (0, T ; H 1(Ω)), such that, up to a sub-
sequence, ΠDm cm → ¯c weakly in L2(0, T , L2(Ω)), and ∇Dm cm → ∇¯c weakly in
L2(0, T , L2(Ω)d ). Estimate (5.5) together with the consistency, limit–conformity
and compactness, [12, Theorem 4.14] proves that, in fact, the convergence of ΠDm cm
to ¯c is strong in L2 (Ω × (0, T )).
Step 2: Convergence of the scheme. We show that ¯c mentioned in the
ﬁrst step is solution to the continuous problem. Take ¯ψ ∈ L2(0, T ; L2(Ω)) such
that ∂t ¯ψ ∈ L2 (Ω × (0, T )) and ¯ψ(T , ·) = 0. The interpolation results in [12,
Lemma 4.10] provides wm = (w(n)
, such that ΠDm wm → ¯ψ in
L2(0, T ; L2(Ω)) and δDm wm → ∂t ¯ψ strongly in L2 (Ω × (0, T )). Set ψ = δ t
as a test function in Scheme (3.3) and sum on n = 0, ..., Nm − 1 to get

Thanks to the strong convergence of ΠDm cm and (3.1), the dominated convergence
theorem implies that F (ΠDm cm ) → F (¯c) in L2 (Ω × (0, T )). By the consistency,
m = ΠDm JDm cini → cini in L2(Ω). Now, we can pass to the limit m → ∞
in each of the terms above to see that ¯c is a solution to (3.2), thanks again to the
weak and strong convergence established previously.
Step 3: Convergence of ΠDm cm in L∞ (0, T ; L2(Ω)). For s ∈ [0, T ], let (sm )m∈N ⊂
[0, T ] be a sequence such that sm → s, as m → ∞. Let k(m) ∈ {0, ..., Nm − 1} such
that sm ∈ (t(k(m)) , t(k(m)+1) ]. As followed in the proof of Lemma 5.1, we obtain as
the discrete estimate (5.2) with Dm and km ,

[12, Theorem 4.19] and Estimates (5.1) and (5.5) states that (ΠDm cm )m∈N con-
verges to ¯c weakly in L2 (Ω) uniformly in [0, T ]. Hence, ΠDm cm (·, sm ) converges
to ¯c(·, s) weakly in L2 (Ω), as m → ∞. Estimate (5.11) with basic justiﬁcations
in Hilbert, this convergence strongly holds in L2(Ω). Since ¯c : [0, T ] → L2 (Ω) is
continuous, apply [12, Lemma C.13] to conclude the proof.
Step 4: Strong Convergence of ∇Dm cm . Since the non linearity does not act
on gradients, the proof can be obtained as in [1] without additional assumptions.

conditions satisfy the three properties; the consistency, the limit conformity and
the compactness. Therefore, Theorem 6.5 provides the convergence of the HMM
and Crouzeix–Raviart schemes for the problem (6.2).
7. Numerical results
We employ the HMM method presented previously to model how a brain tumor
invades an anisotropic environment, as simulated by the macroscopic reaction dif-
fusion model (1.1), where ¯c represents the density of cancerous cells at a given time,
t, and brain location, xxx = (x, y ), which belongs to the square domain Ω = [−L, L]2 ,
with non-ﬂux boundary conditions. The forward Euler method is utilized for the
time-discretization, incorporating the use of time step δ t. In accordance with [5],
we utilize the initial data, incorporating several distorted Gaussian functions that
are focused on a range of points chosen as
¯c(xxx, 0) = 0.8 exp(−0.1(x − 1)2 − 0.3(y − 3)2 )
+ 0.75 exp(−0.25(x − 10)2 − 0.15(y + 9)2 )
+ 0.6 exp(−0.2(x + 3)2 − 0.5(y + 4)2 )
+ 0.5 exp(−0.25(x + 5)2 − 0.3(y − 1)2 ).
7.1. Description of the underlying model.
(7.1)
7.1.1. The diﬀusion term. Returning to the reaction model (1.1), anisotropic dif-
fusion A has a speciﬁc symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix and is regarded as
being in direct proportion to the measured water diﬀusion tensor (DT ) harvested
by DTI data [32, 33]. DT details water molecule diﬀusion employing a Gaussian
model. For a.e. xxx ∈ Ω ⊂ R2 , DT can be represented by [32]
DT (xxx) = λ1φ1φT
1 + λ2φ2φT
2 ,
(7.2)
the non negative λ1 and λ2 are the eigenvalues of A(xxx), and φ1 and φ2 are (orthog-
onal and normalised) eigenvectors corresponding to λ1 and λ2 respectively. The
ANALYSIS OF SCHEMES FOR ANISOTROPIC REACTION DIFFUSION MODELS
17
axis of dominating anisotropy is indicated by the eigenvector φ1 and the degree
of anisotropy is determined by the eigenvalue size [32, 33]. For a.e. xxx ∈ Ω ⊂ R2 ,
computing the diﬀusion tensor A(xxx) from (7.2) is then given as [32]
r2

I2 (M (xxx))
I0 (M (xxx))
I2 (M (xxx))
I0 (M (xxx))
A(xxx) =
((δ + (1 − δ)(1 −
))I + 2(1 − δ)
For the details of computations, we refer the reader to [33]. A is divided into
isotropic (the I term) and anisotropic components; the anisotropy points in the
direction ±φ1 . These terms’ relative sizes are dictated by δ and the function M
[32]. The function M details the concentration levels surrounding the dominant
direction, for a.e. xxx ∈ Ω ⊂ R2 , it is represented by [32]
(7.3)

M (xxx) = κFanis (DT (xxx)),
(7.4)
where κ being a proportionality constant denoting how sensitive the cells are to
directional data within the environment; Fanis represents fractional anisotropy, the
most commonly employed measure for anisotropy. For a.e. xxx ∈ Ω ⊂ R2 , the
fractional anisotropy deﬁned as [32]:
Fanis (DT (xxx)) = |λ1 − λ2 |
pλ2

.
(7.5)
We can think of this as representing the diﬀerence between a perfect sphere and
the ellipsoid form of the tensor [32]. The function Ij denotes the modiﬁed Bessel
function of ﬁrst kind of order j . The constants µ and r respectively represent a
tumor cell’s turning rate and constant average speed [32, 33]. The diﬀusion tensor
A in our model is thus taken here to be an anisotropic informed by DTI diﬀusion
tensor (DT ) given by (7.3) and DT is chosen as [32]
0.5 + d(x, y )(cid:19) ,
0
0
where d(x, y ) = 0.25 exp(−0.05x2) − 0.25 exp(−0.5y 2) and with parameters are
chosen as δ = 0.05, r = 1 and µ = 0.
DT (xxx) = (cid:18)0.5 − d(x, y )
(7.6)
7.1.2. The reaction term. With the proliferation term F (¯c) that details a popu-
lation of tumor cells’ growth, the ma jority of researchers have regarded it as a
quadratic function that may be exponential: F (¯c) = ρ¯c with constant prolifer-
ation rate ρ, illustrating that cellular division is obedient to a cycle, or logistic:
F (¯c) = ρ¯c(1 − ¯c) with a decrease in ρ, the proliferation parameter, for zones of high
cellular density. Nevertheless, in this research, following [5], cell growth is modeled
with a cubic behavior so that the inﬂuence of the threshold of cancer cell density
can be captured, something that is ignored when a quadratic function is employed.
The threshold is a local driver of normal tissue for cancer cell regimes or will not
permit cancer cells to colonize tissues, keeping it free of tumors, and this is an
important factor to consider. Thus we consider a reaction term of [5, 38]:
F (¯c) = ρ¯c(1 − ¯c)(¯c − α),
where 0 < α < 1 represents the cancer generation threshold.
In our work, this
threshold was ﬁxed as α = 0.1 with a rate of proliferation of ρ = 1. This is the
standard measurement used in bistable equation models, as highlighted in [5].

7.2. Tumour growth evolution. We subsequently use simulation of (1.1) to as-
sess the impact that the anisotropic environment has on the spatio-temporal evo-
lution of the glioma tumor at various measurements of κ. The study is performed
in the context of a 2D squared domain Ω = [−20, 20]2 that incorporates a uniform
mesh that consists of 3584 triangular elements, that are taken at diﬀerent times,
denoted by T = 0.2, T = 5, T = 15 and T = 20. The results of simulations are
shown in Fig. 7.1, Fig. 7.2, Fig. 7.3 and Fig. 7.4 for κ = 0, κ = 5, κ = 10 and
κ = 30, respectively. In the case of the isotropic case (κ = 0), the outcomes of
the HMM approach are aligned with the ﬁndings outlined in [5]. We expanded the
research to include the time considerations for the invasion rate in an anisotropic
environment, as depicted in Fig. 7.2, Fig. 7.3 and Fig. 7.4. The ﬁgures show
the density of cancerous cells as a function of time indicating by color-map that is
displayed on the ﬁgures, which spans from the lowest density, blue (¯c = 0), to the
highest density, red (¯c = 1). The simulation commences from a relatively irregular
inhomogeneous initial data (7.1). As time passes, there is a tendency for some of
the regions of cancer to reduce in density. However, by T = 20, the colonization
of one of the peaked populations is observed. The way in which these cancer cells
are diﬀused in a heterogeneous environment within the brain is also taken into
consideration. The isotropic case, κ = 0, can be observed in Fig7.1. In this case,
the tumour cells are equally diﬀused in a myriad of directions and exhibit spher-
ical symmetry. When κ is enhanced from zero the eﬀect that the environmental
anisotropy has on cell turning increases and an increasingly non-uniform invasion
is observed, as can be seen in Fig. 7.2 for κ = 5 , Fig. 7.3 for κ = 10 and Fig. 7.4
for κ = 30. For instance, at T = 20, with κ = 0 a circular invasion can be observed.
This becomes increasingly irregular in shape when κ = 30. The outcome of this is
a distinct disparity between the anisotropic and isotropic cases. As can be clearly
seen, the HMM simulations results, in terms of the expansion of the brain tumours,
are consistent with the results in [32].
7.3. Measure of diﬀusion anisotropy. Researchers have recommended a range
of eigenvalue-based formulae for the purposes of measuring the anisotropy in the
diﬀusion tensor; for example, the fractional anisotropy (Fanis ) measure outlined in
(7.5). Fanis was named such due to the fact that it measures the anisotropic fraction
of the diﬀusion. This measure can be perceived as representative of the variation
between a perfect sphere and the ellipsoid form of the tensor. To investigate this
point in more depth, in Fig. 7.5 we plot the histogram of Fanis for A under (a)
κ = 0, (b) κ = 5, (c) κ = 10 and (d) κ = 30 at the time T = 10. Other parameters
are set as in Fig. 7.1. Fanis is normalized to attain values in [0, 1] with Fanis = 0
corresponding to the isotropic case as in (a) for κ = 0 and Fanis = 1 denoting a
completely anisotropic case as clearly observed in (d) for κ = 30. Moreover, the
maximum value of the Fanis increases from around of 0.6 to approximately 0.8 as
the parameter κ is increased from κ = 5 to κ = 10. This demonstrates that there
is a strong dependency on the κ anisotropy enhancement parameter.
7.4. Anisotropy under diﬀerent Meshes. The most robust feature of the HMM
approach is that it can be employed on multiple forms of meshes in a variety of
space dimensions, with relatively limited limitations on the control volumes, see the
numerical tests described by [21]. We applied the HMM approach to our anisotropic
reaction diﬀusion model for four diﬀerent types of meshes, presented in Fig. 7.7 for
ANALYSIS OF SCHEMES FOR ANISOTROPIC REACTION DIFFUSION MODELS
19
κ = 0 and in Fig. 7.8 for κ = 100 at time T = 2. Other parameters are chosen as in
Fig. 7.1. The ﬁrst two types (a and b) were constructed on a triangular mesh that
included 3584 cells, and on a rectangular mesh that included 1024 control volumes.
The third type was constructed on hexagonal cells, with the number of cells equal to
6561. The fourth type of mesh was inspired by Kershowa [21] and it includes 4624
control volumes. While this form of mesh is associated with intense distortions,
the dynamics of the brain tumor is still captured by the HMM scheme, even in
the event of a highly heterogeneous anisotropic case; for example, that presented
in Fig. 7.8 for κ = 100.
